# Privacy Policy
> **Note:** This section only applies to the Tanndev-hosted instances of the bot.
> It's an open-source project, so we can't control what other people choose to do with the code.
> Unfortunately, that includes modifying it to try and steal your information.
> Take caution when interacting with an instance of SAU that doesn't come from us.
 
In order to work properly, the bot needs to store some information about you:
- Your Discord user ID
- The last in-game name you provided via `!sau join <name>`

As we add more features, we may need to store more information. However, we have a few policies:
- Your Discord ID is the only way we'll identify you. We'll never collect your real name or email address.
- We only care about the game. We won't store anything not directly related to Among Us, or your interaction with the bot.
- We'll never sell your information. To anyone. Ever.

## Right to Access Data
You can get a copy of all the information the bot knows about you by using the command `show-me` via DM or text channel.
(Of course, you need to use the appropriate command prefix if you send it in a channel.)

The bot will DM you with a record of everything it knows about you.

## Right to be Forgotten
If, at any time, you'd like the bot to forget everything it's ever recorded about you, it's really easy.

All you have to do is use the `forget-me` command via DM or text channel.
(Of course, you need to use the appropriate command prefix if you send it in a channel.)
